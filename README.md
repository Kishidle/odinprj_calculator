# odinprj_calculator
# For Odin Project's JS Foundation Calculator project

An online calculator created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, for the purpose of learning said languages.

# Things I learned when making this project
* Event Listeners and Keyboard listeners
* Instead of using Flexbox, I tried to use Grid instead for the layout
* Using objects

# Reflections
* Took quite longer than I thought to do
* Had to rewrite the code once, felt my approach was too convoluted (Values were only stored once an operand or the 'Equals' button was pressed)
